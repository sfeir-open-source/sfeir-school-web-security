# CVSS

- CVSS: Common Vulnerability Scoring System
- A numerical score, reflecting the severity
  - Between 0 and 10
  - Includes attack vectors, complexity, required privileges, user interaction required, impacts...
- A vector string, reflecting metrics
- Not a measure of risk !
- CVSS v2, v3, v3.1, v4
<!-- .element: class="list-fragment" -->

Notes:
- risk: depends on the usage of the vulnerable software / feature, the severity of the software that includes it, etc  
- versions: evolutions of the computation method
  - 06/2023: v3.1 = latest, v4 = in preview

# CVSS score

- Base score: provided online for all CVE
- Final score:
<!-- .element: class="list-fragment" -->
  - base score
  - temporal score
  - environment
<!-- .element: class="list-fragment" -->

Notes:
- temporal: metric that changes over time: exploit code maturity, remediation level (eg patch available?), report confidence
- environmental: depends on the company's env. Eg: mitigation measures in place ? Compensating controls ? Firewall ? Unused / isolated server ?
- there are other scores than cvss:
  - EPSS (Exploit Prediction Scoring System) - likelihood that a vulnerability will be exploited soon (measure of threat)
  - SSVC (GitHub - CERTCC/SSVC: Stakeholder-Specific Vulnerability Categorization)
