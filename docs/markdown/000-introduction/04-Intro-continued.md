  - [lunch]
  - Hand's on exercise
  - Major vulnerabilities - discovery and examples (part 2)
  - Hand's on exercise + answers
- Methodologies and tools
<!-- .element: class="list-fragment" -->

Notes:
- websec overview: guidelines, examples attacks & vulnerabilities, impacts, convince people to invest in security
- methodo/tools: starting from scratch - where to begin ? methodologies, tools

# Out of scope

- General IT Security
  - network, infrastructure (docker, kubernetes...)
  - social engineering
  - physical security...
- Framework-specific security
  - e.g. Spring, Django, NestJS security features
- Cloud-specific security
- How to implement specific security frameworks from A to Z
<!-- .element: class="list-fragment" -->

Notes:
- Our main focus is web security
- cloud: Only briefly discussed
- Methodologies and frameworks are discussed, but we stay generic here
- we share resources at the end to explore these domains
