# How to convince the management to invest in (web) security



##==##

# Convince who ?

- Your client, your company
- Identify who is in charge of such decisions
<!-- .element: class="list-fragment" -->
  - CISO (Chief Information Security Officer / RSSI in French), risk manager
  - The management / the board / CIO / ...
- Sometimes your client / manager cannot decide by himself
<!-- .element: class="list-fragment" -->

Notes:
- identify who can take such decisions
- client cannot decide himself: but should be convinced anyway



##==##

# Convince of what ?

- Enough budget / time for the project's security
  - But what is "enough" ?
- You should already have estimations / a plan in mind
  - First actions / priorities
- Not a one-time budget
- Security also from a business perspective
<!-- .element: class="list-fragment" -->

Notes:
- realistic plan: if nothing is secure, do not start by pentest / bugbounty
- the client cannot just "give money and forget security"



##==##

# Speech

- Several things to explain => presentation
- For non-technical people: avoid technical terms!
- Use examples
- Show concrete risks
- Propose a plan
<!-- .element: class="list-fragment" -->

Notes:
- If there is a CISO, try to get his help
- Risks: analysis to be done for your specific case


##==##

# Duties (towards users, clients...)

- Consultancy companies are expected to provide secure developments
- Security is mandatory for compliance (ISO 27001, PCI DSS...)
- Security can be mandatory (requested by insurance companies)
- GDPR - obligation to disclose data leaks to users
- Clients are expecting secure services
<!-- .element: class="list-fragment" -->

Notes:
- Cyberattack insurance => obligations (mostly pentests => better to start securing yourself)



##==##

# Risks

- Many risks, impacts can be big
- Identify the risks that apply to your company / project
- Gather objective data
<!-- .element: class="list-fragment" -->

## Risks - reputation

Notes:
- (Warren Buffett: American billionaire and investor)



##==##

# Risks - reputation

- Trust from users/clients is very important
- Loss of trust: can have big impact on long term revenues
<!-- .element: class="list-fragment" -->



##==##

# Risks - money and time lost

- Cost of repairing the system / website
  - may include the costs of external consultants
- Cost of business interruption
- Costs related to lost data (including fines)
- Costs related to the loss of trust
<!-- .element: class="list-fragment" -->

Notes:
- business interruption: no more sales, employees sometimes cannot work...
- All these costs: more than the security investment cost

# Risks - money and time lost - examples

- cyberattack on Anvers city (12/2022): cost of 70 million euros ([source](https://datanews.levif.be/actualite/les-couts-de-la-cyber-attaque-contre-la-ville-danvers-pourraient-selever-a-70-millions-deuros/))
- Picanol (Belgian company listed on the stock exchange): 1500 employees on standby ([source](https://www.lecho.be/entreprises/textile/picanol-victime-de-ce-qui-pourrait-etre-la-plus-grande-cyberattaque-belge/10198267.html))
- "60% of small businesses fail after a cyberattack." ([source](https://worldr.com/blog/60-of-small-businesses-fail-after-a-cyberattack.-why) , [source](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/13/cyberattacks-cost-small-companies-200k-putting-many-out-of-business.html))

## Common reaction

<blockquote>
<cite>
  Not likely to happen to us... We are too small... Hackers aren't interested in us... And it costs a lot !
</cite>
</blockquote>

Notes:
- Rarely true
- Company has valuable data => threaten to divulge it, or to make it disappear
- Attacks cost more!
- Risk is high (see many examples on internet)




##==##

# The plan

- Evaluate the potential costs of an attack
- Evaluate the security investment cost in the near future
- Prepare a step-by-step plan
  - Includes one-time actions (setup processes, fix big security holes)
  - But also regular actions (security reviews, trainings, udpates of the plan...)
- Realistic and coherent plan
<!-- .element: class="list-fragment" -->

Notes:
- Costs: compute return on security investment (what cost does the investment avoid)
- The plan: depends on the current security state. What is already in place ?
- Realistic: relative to company size, data criticality, actual risks
